# Troubleshooting FPS Drop

Check your speedtest otherwise it's the ISP

Check the GFN Telemetry and let it on auto

If nothing works turn down your settings

Restart your session, you can get another roll on the rig table

About the new session

I'll be lucky if I restart but how much luck I have

you are not 'lucky', in 2/3 restarts you usally have the right rig for the game and for some exceptional games + rtx on games, the 2080 rigs are the best

note that 1080c does not use a gtx 1080 and a 2080c rig also does not use a 2080/ti.

they just named them like that, all gfn rigs have server cpu's and server gpu's like xeon and tesla p40's - T-8/10
