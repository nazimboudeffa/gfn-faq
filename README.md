# GeForceNow FAQ

First of all, any kind of exploitation is not permitted for example playing GTA5 knowing that it's not in the list of games, maybe the rules will change later but actually they are stated like what you read here

The official community FAQ is here https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/wiki/index

So let's go on this FAQ to let you have the best gaming experience on the GeForce Now cloud service

Can I come and talk about exploitation
---

NO, it's not okay to exploit a vulnerability to play what you want

There are no bug bounty program for GFN at the moment

Can I use a VPN
---

NO, it's fine to use alternative servers so long as you are in supported regions, but it's not okay to use a VPN to buy Founders outside of your region

How long will the  founders editon be avavible for purchase
---

untill its out of stock and it depends on how much people buy it and how much stock they have

Why when I launch my game it doesn't fit my screen
---

gfn doesnt save graphic settings in major part of games so you have to change the display each restart

Is there a One Session list of games
---

Yes there is the [official one](http://gfngames.tk) and the [HIDDEN](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/ha3yir/hidden_supported_games/) (*joking only*)

What is FPS
---

think of it like this
if your hdmi cable can only deliver 60 fps
even if your graphics card renders a game at 500
u will only get 60 frames per sec on your screen

Why my ping is smaller then speedtest
---
speedtest in GFN measures and pings the speed to your chosen GFN location. A regular speedtest pings ur nearest server which is totally not the same as gfn

GFN mesures the bandwidth of the ping to the NVidia Grid near your location while speedtest uses other servers or their own
